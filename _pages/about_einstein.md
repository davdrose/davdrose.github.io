I’m a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University where I am advised Tobias Gerstenberg and Ellen Markman. 

My research is mainly focused on causal reasoning and categorization. 
causal reasoning: my recent work has focused on the development of different causal verbs, such as “burn” and “break”, as well as “cause”, and how this language maps onto different kinds of causes. 
categorization: much of my recent work has explored the role of teleological thinking (i.e., thinking about the purpose or function of things) in categorization. To take just one example, some of my work has explored the ways in which providing information about what things, such as artifacts and animals, are for can help children override their reliance on perceptual similarity in categorization.

I did my undergraduate work at Ohio University where I studied philosophy and psychology. I was supervised by the late Mark Alicke and worked together with him on the role of blame in causal judgment. I then went to Carnegie Mellon University and worked with David Danks on causation. From there, I then went to Rutgers University where I earned a PhD in Philosophy under the supervision of Jonathan Schaffer and Stephen Stich. My dissertation research was focused on the role of teleological thinking in judgments about object composition and persistence and the epistemic consequences of this for debates about the nature of material objects.
