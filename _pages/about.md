<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

<!-- I’m a graduate student in the <span style="color: #00ab37;">Department of Psychology at Stanford University</span> where I am advised by <span style="color: #00ab37;">Tobias Gerstenberg</span> and <span style="color: #00ab37;">Ellen Markman</span>. 

My research is mainly focused on <span style="color: #00ab37;">causal reasoning</span> and <span style="color: #00ab37;">categorization</span>. My recent work on
<span style="color: #00ab37;">causal reasoning</span> has focused on the development of different <span style="color: #00ab37;">causal verbs</span>, such as “<span style="color: #00ab37;">burn</span>” and “<span style="color: #00ab37;">break</span>”, as well as “<span style="color: #00ab37;">cause</span>”, and <span style="color: #00ab37;">how, and when, this language maps onto different kinds of causes</span>, and what this reveals about <span style="color: #00ab37;">the development of causal thought</span>. Much of my recent work on <span style="color: #00ab37;">categorization</span> has explored <span style="color: #00ab37;">the role of teleological thinking</span> (i.e., thinking about the purpose or function of things) <span style="color: #00ab37;">in categorization</span>, developing and defending a novel view of essentialist categorization, <span style="color: #00ab37;">teleological essentialism</span>, and investigating the ways in which <span style="color: #00ab37;">teleological thinking helps children build abstract category representations</span>. 

I did my undergraduate work at <span style="color: #00ab37;">Ohio University</span> where I studied <span style="color: #00ab37;">philosophy</span> and <span style="color: #00ab37;">psychology</span>. I was supervised by the late <span style="color: #00ab37;">Mark Alicke</span> and worked on causation. I then went to <span style="color: #00ab37;">Carnegie Mellon University</span> and worked with <span style="color: #00ab37;">David Danks</span> on causation. From there, I went to <span style="color: #00ab37;">Rutgers University</span> where I worked on causation and categorization, and earned a <span style="color: #00ab37;">PhD in Philosophy</span> under the supervision of <span style="color: #00ab37;">Jonathan Schaffer</span> and <span style="color: #00ab37;">Stephen Stich</span>. -->

I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University where I am advised by Tobias Gerstenberg and Ellen Markman. Before coming to Stanford, I earned a PhD in Philosophy from Rutgers University under the supervision of Jonathan Schaffer and Stephen Stich. 

How we reason about objects and events is a central focus of my research. Specifically, two broad questions guide my research. How do we determine what makes something the kind of thing that it is? And how do we determine what causes what? I take an interdisciplinary approach to answering these questions, drawing on cognitive and developmental psychology, linguistics and philosophy, and make use of a variety of tools, including experiments with adults and children, as well as computational tools in linguistics, along with inspiration from computational models.
