<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I’m a graduate student in the <span style="color: #00ab37;">Department of Psychology at Stanford University</span> where I am advised <span style="color: #00ab37;">Tobias Gerstenberg</span> and <span style="color: #00ab37;">Ellen Markman</span>. 

My research is mainly focused on <span style="color: #00ab37;">causal reasoning</span> and <span style="color: #00ab37;">categorization</span>. 
<span style="color: #00ab37;">causal reasoning</span>: my recent work has focused on the development of different <span style="color: #00ab37;">causal verbs</span>, such as “<span style="color: #00ab37;">burn</span>” and “<span style="color: #00ab37;">break</span>”, as well as “<span style="color: #00ab37;">cause</span>”, and <span style="color: #00ab37;">how this language maps onto different kinds of causes</span>. 
<span style="color: #00ab37;">categorization</span>: much of my recent work has explored <span style="color: #00ab37;">the role of teleological thinking</span> (i.e., thinking about the purpose or function of things) <span style="color: #00ab37;">in categorization</span>. To take just one example, some of my work has explored the ways in which providing information about what things, such as artifacts and animals, are for can help children override their reliance on perceptual similarity in categorization.

I did my undergraduate work at <span style="color: #00ab37;">Ohio University</span> where I studied <span style="color: #00ab37;">philosophy</span> and <span style="color: #00ab37;">psychology</span>. I was supervised by the late <span style="color: #00ab37;">Mark Alicke</span> and worked together with him on the role of blame in causal judgment. I then went to <span style="color: #00ab37;">Carnegie Mellon University</span> and worked with <span style="color: #00ab37;">David Danks</span> on causation. From there, I then went to <span style="color: #00ab37;">Rutgers University</span> where I earned a <span style="color: #00ab37;">PhD in Philosophy</span> under the supervision of <span style="color: #00ab37;">Jonathan Schaffer</span> and <span style="color: #00ab37;">Stephen Stich</span>. My dissertation research was focused on the role of teleological thinking in judgments about object composition and persistence and the epistemic consequences of this for debates about the nature of material objects.
